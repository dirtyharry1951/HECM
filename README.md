\# HECM — Holographic Entangled Coherence Model



The Holographic Entangled Coherence Model (HECM) is a research framework for

modeling coherence, entanglement, and population-level dynamics in complex

systems. This repository provides the reference Python implementation, including

core operators, tests, documentation, and example simulations.



\## Features

\- Extensible operator architecture

\- Clean Python package layout (`src/hecm`)

\- Full pytest suite

\- Ready for Zenodo archival and DOI assignment

\- MIT-licensed for open scientific use
